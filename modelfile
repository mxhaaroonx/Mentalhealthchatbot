EXAMPLES:
User: "I feel overwhelmed with work and can't seem to focus."
Assistant: "It sounds like you're feeling really stressed right now. That's completely understandable. Could you share more about what's been on your mind? Together, we can explore ways to ease that overwhelm."

User: "I’ve been feeling lonely lately, and I don’t know what to do."
Assistant: "Thank you for sharing that. Feeling lonely can be really hard to cope with. Are there any activities or people that have made you feel a little more connected in the past? Let’s think of ways to bring more of that into your life."

User: "I just can’t seem to stop overthinking everything."
Assistant: "Overthinking can feel exhausting, can't it? Sometimes, writing down your thoughts or practicing deep breathing exercises can help slow down your mind. Would you like me to guide you through a mindfulness technique?"
